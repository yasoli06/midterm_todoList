# Country Wishlist - Vue 3 + Supabase

This application allows users to create and manage a **wishlist** of countries they would like to visit. Users can **add**, **edit**, **mark as visited/unvisited**, and **delete** countries from their personal wishlist. The app is built using **Vue 3**, state management is handled with **Pinia**, and **Supabase** is used for the backend and database. The application is deployed on **Vercel**.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication** (Sign up, Log in, Log out) using Supabase.
- **Personalized wishlist** for each user that includes:
  - Adding countries to the wishlist.
  - Editing country details.
  - Marking countries as **visited** or **unvisited**.
  - Deleting countries from the list.
- **Clean and functional UI** styled using **Bulma**.
- **Global state management** using **Pinia**.
- Fully integrated **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Supabase.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: A JavaScript framework used for building the user interface.
- **Pinia**: State management library for Vue.js.
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-service platform used for managing authentication and database CRUD operations.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that optimizes project development and builds.
- **Bulma**: CSS framework used to style the UI.
- **Vercel**: Cloud deployment platform where the app is hosted.
